WHEREAS, Affiliate desires to participate in the Flywheel Affiliate Program, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

### 1. REFERRAL SERVICES

As of the Effective Date (only upon written approval of Affiliate's Application), Affiliate is authorized to market and promote the Flywheel Services to potential Customers (the "Referral Services"), in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Affiliate agrees to perform the Referral Services in accordance with the following and subject to such other written rules and guidelines as Flywheel may establish for the Affiliate Program and publish on the Flywheel website from time to time:

(a)	Affiliate shall place a hyperlink on its website, in a format approved by Flywheel, that when clicked on redirects the visitor to the Flywheel website (a "Link").

Affiliate will not utilize any paid advertising mediums, including pay-per-click, network display banners, or comparison shopping engines, without submitting a written marketing plan to Flywheel and obtaining Flywheel's written approval. Affiliate will not be allowed to bid on any iteration of the following keywords for the purposes of generating a Referral Fee:
* Flywheel
* Flywheel Hosting
* Flywheel WordPress Hosting
* Fly Wheel
* getflywheel

Affiliate agrees to provide keyword lists, ads, advertising cookies, and any other data to Flywheel upon request and to make any modifications requested in a timely manner.

(b)	Any materials used in connection with the Referral Services will be developed and produced solely and exclusively by Flywheel, and no marketing, advertising or promotional materials other than those provided by Flywheel may be used by Affiliate to perform Referral Services under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Flywheel.

(c)	Affiliate shall not make any promises or representations or give any warranties, guarantees or indemnities in respect of the Flywheel Services, except as such are contained in the then-current Flywheel Terms of Service or such other customer agreement as may be agreed-upon by Flywheel related to the Flywheel Services a “Customer Agreement”) or as otherwise expressly authorized by Flywheel in writing.

(d)	Affiliate shall perform the Referral Services in a manner that will reflect favorably on the Flywheel Services and on the good name and reputation of Flywheel, and shall not alone or with others participate in any illegal, deceptive, misleading, or unethical practices, including but not limited to disparagement of the Flywheel Services or Flywheel. Affiliate further agrees to refrain from performing Referral Services using bulk email messages (also known as “spam”). Affiliate’s failure to abide by this Section 1(d), the CAN-SPAM Act, and all applicable laws relating to email communications, in any manner, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Affiliate and will result in the forfeiture of any and all rights Affiliate may have to any Referral Fees (as that term is defined below) and the termination of this Agreement.

(e) A Referral Fee will not be payable for any activity occurring before an Affiliate Program Application is formally accepted. Any previously referred or pending plans will be ineligible for a Referral Fee.

(f) Affiliate agrees to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines concerning advertising and marketing, including without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Endorsement Guides, which require disclosure of material connections between advertisers and endorsers. This means that all Affiliate sites (e.g., directories, review/rating websites, blogs, and other websites) and any email or collateral that provide an endorsement or assessment of Flywheel’s Services must prominently disclose the fact that Affiliate receives compensation for Referred Customers.

(g) Affiliate agrees to comply with all applicable data protection laws regarding the transmission of data exported to or from the United States or the country in which Affiliate resides, including without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”). Affiliate agrees to promptly assist Flywheel in complying with any data subject rights request under the GDPR that Flywheel may receive from any individuals referred to Flywheel by Affiliate. Affiliate further agrees to promptly assist Flywheel in complying with any duties to cooperate with supervisory authorities under the GDPR.

### 2. REFERRAL FEE

(a) In consideration of Affiliate’s performance of Referral Services hereunder, Flywheel agrees to pay Affiliate a referral fee (“Referral Fee”) in accordance with Flywheel’s current affiliate pricing schedule, available at [http://getflywheel.com/affiliates](http://getflywheel.com/affiliates), with respect to each Customer that is referred to Flywheel by Affiliate (a “Referred Customer”). For purposes of this Agreement, a Customer will be considered a Referred Customer only if:

  (1) the Customer is redirected to the Flywheel website through the Affiliate’s Link and such Customer creates a new customer account with Flywheel and accepts the then-current Flywheel Customer Agreement; or

  (2) the Affiliate creates an account and utilizes the Flywheel Services on behalf of a Customer of the Affiliate and such Customer enters into a Customer Agreement with Flywheel. Affiliate may not remain on the account as the sole owner. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that ownership of the account must be transferred to the Customer for the Referral Fee to be paid. 

(b) Affiliate agrees and acknowledges that Flywheel’s obligation to pay Affiliate is contingent upon Flywheel receiving payment from the Referred Customer in accordance with the Customer Agreement. The Referred Customer's account with Flywheel must be in good standing at the time of payout or any Referral Fee will be forfeited. Additionally, if any Referred Customer account is determined to be fake or fraudulent by Flywheel in its sole discretion, the Referral Fee will be forfeited. The Referral Fee shall be Affiliate’s sole compensation under this Agreement and Affiliate shall have no right to receive any additional commission, license fee, expense reimbursement or other payment in connection with this Agreement. Affiliate’s right to receive Referral Fees is subject to and limited by the termination rights under Section 4.

(c) Affiliate shall not transfer any site to another account created solely for the purpose of generating a Referral Fee. Affiliate shall not self-refer or refer a site to another party within an organization. Affiliate shall not refer sites to a member of their immediate families unless a formal business arrangement exists and the family member is a paying customer.

(d) The Referral Fee will be paid via PayPal to the email address provided with the Application. Flywheel will not be liable for payments made to an incorrect email address.
