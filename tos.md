## 1. Services.

### 1.1 Flywheel Services.  

Flywheel agrees to provide Client access to Flywheel's proprietary Platform, as further described in Section 1.2 below, and associated hosting and support services related to the development and management of Client's WordPress website (the "Website") as set forth or as described during the registration process (the "Website Services"). Flywheel shall provide the Website Services so that the Website is accessible to third parties.  Except as expressly provided herein, Client agrees that Flywheel is responsible only for providing the Website Services, and Flywheel is not responsible for providing any services or performing any tasks not specifically agreed to between Flywheel and Client during the registration process.  At the time of execution of this Agreement, to the extent that Client wishes to receive from Flywheel, and Flywheel  wishes to provide to Client, services other than the Website Services (collectively, the "Additional Services"), such Additional Services and the arrangements for their provision shall be set forth in a separate addendum to this Agreement which is duly executed by the Parties (the "Services Addendum"), and the Services Addendum shall be incorporated into, and become a part of this Agreement.  The Website Services and the Additional Services will hereinafter be referred to collectively as the "Services".

Flywheel hereby grants to Client during the Term a non-exclusive, worldwide, limited license granting Client access to Flywheel’s software and proprietary technology (the "Platform"), which will allow Client to (a) use and receive the Flywheel Services, and (b) access the Flywheel web portal for purposes of developing and managing the Website as part of the Flywheel Services.  Client acknowledges that the Platform and its structure, organization, and source code constitute valuable trade secrets of Flywheel and its licensors.  Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, Client agrees that Client shall not, and shall not permit any third party, to: (a) reproduce, modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of the Platform; (b) sublicense, distribute, sell, use for service bureau use, lease, rent, loan, or otherwise transfer the Platform to any third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile,  disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Platform; (d) remove, alter, cover or obfuscate any copyright notices or other proprietary rights notices included in the Platform; or (e) otherwise use or copy the Platform except as expressly permitted under this Agreement.

In the event of any loss or interruption of Flywheel Services, Client’s sole and exclusive remedy and Flywheel’s sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Flywheel Services shall be as follows: for loss or interruption of Flywheel Services which is due to (i) causes other than scheduled maintenance and required repairs; (ii) causes beyond the control of Flywheel; or (iii) causes which are not reasonably foreseeable by Flywheel, including, but not limited to, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links and Internet slow-downs or failures, which loss or interruption of Flywheel Services exceeds a continual period of twenty-four (24) hours, Client shall receive a credit against future Flywheel Services equal to a pro rata portion of Flywheel Services fees for the period of downtime.

## 4. Fees and Taxes.

### 4.1 Payment.

Website Services shall be paid in United States Dollars ("USD") by valid payment method (acceptable to Flywheel) at the time of purchase at the fee set forth on Flywheel's website.

If Client initiates a chargeback with the provider of a credit card or initiates a similar action to a payment provider allowed by Flywheel for charges billed by Flywheel for Website Services, Website Services will be immediately suspended without notice.

### 4.3 Increase in Fees.

Flywheel expressly reserves the right to change the fees charged hereunder for the  Website Services with advanced notice to the Client.  If Client does not agree to any such pricing change, it may cancel the Website Services within thirty (30) days from the date of your notice; otherwise all such changes shall be effective with respect to Client's account and Client agrees that Flywheel is authorized to charge the payment method provided by Client for any new Website Services Fee, on the next monthly or annual (as applicable) payment cycle.

### 4.5 Breach for Failure to Pay.

Failure of Client to fully pay any fees within sixty (60) days after the applicable due date shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of the Services by Flywheel, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by Flywheel. Any such suspension does not relieve Client from paying past due fees plus interest and in the event of collection enforcement, Client shall be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, but not limited to, legal costs, attorneys’ fees, court costs and collection agency fees.

### 4.6 Taxes.

Client shall pay or reimburse Flywheel for all sales, use, value-added, transfer, privilege, excise, and all other taxes and all duties, whether international, national, state or local, however designated, which are levied or imposed by reason of the performance by Flywheel under this Agreement; excluding, however, income taxes on profits which may be levied against Flywheel.

### 9.7 Governing Law.

This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Nebraska without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and without regard to the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

### 9.8	Dispute Resolution.

(a)	For any claim arising under this Agreement where (i) the total amount of the award sought is equal to or greater than $10,000.00 USD or the relief sought is injunctive or other equitable relief, and (ii) Client is a citizen of the United States of America or an entity organized under the laws of any state therein, Client and Flywheel agree that the sole venue and jurisdiction for such disputes arising from this Agreement shall be the appropriate state or federal court located in Douglas County, Nebraska, and Client and Flywheel hereby submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. 

(b)	For any claim arising under this Agreement (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000.00 USD, Client or Flywheel may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If a party elects arbitration, that party will initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. In any such arbitration, the ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrability of this section shall be determined in accordance with federal law and the Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to the specific requirements of any states’ arbitration laws.

(c)	If Client is not a citizen of the United States of America or an entity organized under the laws of any state therein or if Sections 9.8(a) or (b) above do not apply, all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the execution thereof shall be amicably settled through negotiation.  In case no settlement can be reached, disputes arising out of or in connection with the present Agreement shall be submitted to mandatory, final and binding arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the  Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration and the provisions of this Section 9.8(c), with the arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce.  There shall be one arbitrator, who will be agreed to by the parties within 30 days of receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration.  If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within the time period specified then, at the request of either party, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce.  Each party hereby irrevocably waives any present or future objection to any such venue, and irrevocably consents and submits unconditionally to the exclusive jurisdiction for itself and in respect of any of its property of any such arbitral court.  Judgment may be entered on the award by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any judicial proceeding permitted under this Agreement.  Arbitral awards shall be rendered within nine (9) months of the commencement of the arbitration, unless such time limit is extended by the arbitrator.  Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange shall be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents explicitly referred to by a party for the purpose of supporting relevant facts presented in its case, carried out expeditiously.  Arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online video conferencing, and/or be solely based on written submissions—the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. Arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.  The language of the arbitration shall be English.  In an action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Section 9.8(c), the prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator, shall be entitled to recover costs (including the fees of the arbitration) and attorneys’ fees from the other party (or parties).
