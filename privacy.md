This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identiﬁable information we receive from users of the Site. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information (also known as "personal data") and how you can access and update that information.  Personal Information is information about you that can be used, directly or indirectly, to identify you (e.g., name, email address, mailing address, date of birth).

We use your Personal Information only for the purposes of registration, billing, and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise deﬁned in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings as in our [Terms of Service](https://getflywheel.com/legal/terms-service/).

Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as: your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the time and date of your visit, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time you spend on those pages, and other site usage statistics.

### Information Collected By Our Customers

Our customers may collect personal data in connection with the service we provide to them. Our customers control the personal data they collect, and we will not use or disclose that personal data except as authorized or directed by the customer in the course of our provision of the services. If your personal data is controlled by one of our customers and you have concerns about the way that data is managed, please contact that customer directly.

For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://getflywheel.com/legal/cookie-policy/).

## How We Use Information

We strongly believe in both minimizing the Personal Information we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the services, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes. 

### Communicating With You  

We will only use the Personal Information we collect as reasonably necessary (a) to allow you to use and interact with the Site; (b) to provide the services to you as our customer; (c) to inform our continued development of the Site and the services; (d) to communicate with you from time to time in response to your requests for information or as may be relevant to your account with us; (e) to send marketing communications related to the services we provide; (f) as required by applicable law or legal requirements pertaining to records retention or for internal administrative purposes; or (g) as specifically authorized by you in writing.

From time to time, we may use your Personal Information to contact you by e-mail concerning our services.

If you do not want to receive email from us or our affiliates regarding new services, please click the "unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email you receive from us. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we will continue to send you emails regarding your account administration, as well as any necessary information, such as renewal notices and instructions. By providing us with your email address you consent to receiving communications from us electronically and all notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

### Compliance With Legal Or Law Enforcement Requests 

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.  When permitted, we will disclose to any customer that is the subject of a government investigation and any data requests pertaining to customers' Personal Information and/or hosted data. 

### Transfer of Personal Information Abroad  

If you utilize our services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your communications with us may result in transferring your Personal Information across international borders.  Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from outside your country of origin. In these cases, your Personal Information is handled according to this Privacy Policy.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we use generally accepted security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alternation of the information under our control, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Third Party Service Providers

We may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments, serving advertisements, performing analyses of our services, and customer relationship management.  We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested services.  These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your Personal Information for any secondary purposes.

## Supplemental Information

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have.  If others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which is was provided to us.

## What Happens to My Personal Information When I Terminate My Account?

When your account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your Personal Information is deleted and/or anonymized. However, deactivation of your account does not mean your Personal Information has been deleted from our database entirely.  We may keep your Personal Information for as long as reasonably required to meet the purposes described herein. Additionally, we will retain this information as required by law, as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Your Rights Over Personal Information We Control

Upon request we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information.  You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by contacting us at <privacy@getflywheel.com>. 

To deactivate your account, please contact us at <https://getflywheel.com/help>. 

We will respond to your request for access or to modify or deactivate your information within thirty (30) days.

Note that when your Personal Information is reasonably necessary for us to provide you services, or for the operation of our network, the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information is required and you cannot opt-out or delete the information without terminating your services.  If your Personal Information is not reasonably necessary for the provisioning of the services or for the operation of our system, you will have the choice to withdraw your consent by opting out.  For example, where you have provided express consent for the use of specific services for marketing purposes, you can opt-out later on as you like.  Similarly, you can opt-out of your Personal Information being used for a variety of marketing communications by us, including telemarketing or addressed marketing mail, or commercial electronic messages like emails and SMS messages by modifying your subscription settings.

### Use of Personal Information

We may use, or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:

- To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you share your name and contact information to request a price quote or ask a question about our products or services, we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry. If you provide your personal information to purchase a product or service, we will use that information to process your payment and facilitate delivery.

- We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.

### Sharing Personal Information

We disclose all of the above categories of personal information to our third-party service providers subject, in each case, to a written contract that describes the business purpose of the disclosure and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.

### Sales of Personal Information

We do not and will not sell your personal information.

### Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will provide:

- The categories of personal information we collected about you.
- The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
- Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
- The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
- The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
- The categories of personal information we sold to a purchaser, and the categories of recipients.
- The categories of personal information we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of recipients.

### Deletion Request Rights

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

- Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
- Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
- Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
- Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
- Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
- Comply with a legal obligation.
- Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

### Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, you can contact us as described below. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. 

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

### Response Timing and Format

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

- Deny you goods or services.
- Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
- Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
- Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. 

California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an electronic message through our website or write us at our address listed on our webpage.
